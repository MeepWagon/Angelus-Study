# Body
I am trying to compile GTK and all its dependencies statically using my custom toolchain,  [^5]==which is based on glibc-2.29==. The toolchain was built using crosstool-ng and targets x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.

What I Have:
- [^1]==A working toolchain with static libraries== (`libc.a`, `libm.a`, `libstdc++.a`, etc.).
- [^2]==LLVM/Clang toolchain for building software.==
- GTK source and its dependencies (glib, pango, cairo, gdk-pixbuf, etc.).

What I Need Help With:
1. Dependency Handling:
	- What is the best way to build and link all GTK dependencies statically?
	- [^6]==Are there any known issues when statically compiling dependencies like glib or pango?==
2. Build Configuration:
	- [^3]==What meson or autotools options should I use to enforce static linking?==
	- Are there any flags required for `pkg-config` to locate static libraries?
3. Toolchain Compatibility:
	- [^4]==Do I need to patch any dependency to ensure compatibility with glibc-2.29?==
	- Has anyone successfully built a fully static GTK binary with a similar setup?

Any guidance, experience, or recommended steps would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
# Keywords
- **toolchain**: A set of tools used to develop, build, debug, and deploy applications. Each "tool" performs some function on the source code before passing it onto the next.
- **glibc**: The standard implementation of the C library used in most linux based systems.
- **crosstool-ng**: A tool for building cross-compilation toolchains. Research more on this, [link](https://crosstool-ng.github.io/) to Github.
- **autotools**: CMake alternative, part of the GNU build system. Write more on this
- **x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu**: A target triplet, a standardized way to describe system architecture, vendor, OS, ABI (application binary interface).
	- x86_64 = CPU architecture (Alternatives: armv7, aarch64, i686, riscv64)
	- unknown = vendor (Often omitted. Alternatives: pc, none, apple)
	- linux = operating system (Alternatives: windows, android, none)
	- gnu = ABI/ C library (Alternatives: musl, uclibc, mingw32)
   Other common triplets:
	- x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (Standard linux on x86_64)
	- aarch64-linux-gnu (ARM64 linux)
	- arm-none-eabi ARM bare-metal (No OS, typically used for microcontrollers)
	- x86_64-w64-mingw32 (Windows Executables)
	- Clang/LLVM: A compiler can be broken down into 3 parts: The front end, which includes source code, lexical analysis, and IR code. The middle end, which analyzes and optimizes the IR code. The back end, which actually compiles the IR into machine code. LLVM is a toolchain alternative to something like GCC. The difference between LLVM and GCC, is that code is transformed differently.

# Goal
User is having trouble compiling GTK statically. Wants to figure out how to statically compile it, plus its dependencies within his toolchain.
# Issues
User doesnt know the best way to acquire all of the dependencies in his toolchain, and questions there are issues when compiling them statically.
1. What is the best way to build & link all dependencies statically? Are there any issues with compiling them statically?
	
2. 

---
[^1]: The user has a toolchain setup so any libraries required by C/C++ are linked statically.

[^2]: Instead of GCC, this user is using LLVM + CLANG to compile their source code

[^3]: 

[^4]: What does it mean to patch a dependency?

[^5]: When setting up your own toolchain (Compiler, Linker, Debugger, C Libraries, CI/CD) instead of using a prefabricated solution like GCC. If you're linking your libraries statically, you have to provide them where your linker toolchain's linker can access them.

[^6]: There may be issues if
