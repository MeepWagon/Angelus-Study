This folder is where various analysis of GTK posts are made. I'm very new to the linux environment, and I have no idea how it ticks. That being said, lots of people ask and answer questions on the gnome discourse forum. I intend on analyzing these posts to gain a better understanding of GTK, tools, and systems used to make gnome work.
# Analysis Guide
Each analysis will contain 4 parts:
- Keywords
- The users goal & breaking it down
- Technical details behind the users issue
- Solution/ Answer for the issue
Then, a summary will be put in this file detailing an overview of each analysis
