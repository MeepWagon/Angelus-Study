# Points
- Learn how to traverse, create, and manipulate linked lists from the front and back. With iteration and recursion.
# Problems
- How do I get a specific digit from an integer? (e.g 2 from 128)
	- Fill this out.
# Coding Paradigms
- Imperative Programming
- Declarative Programming
- Functional Programming
- Data Driven Programming
- Object Oriented Programming
- Even Driven Programming
- Data Flow Programming
- Aspect Oriented Programming
- Generic Programming
# System Design
- Vertical Scalability:
- Horizontal Scalability
- Latency
- Throughput
- Goal is to balance scalability & consistency
- Distributed systems have limitations
	- Cap Theorem: 
- Load balancers exist to distribute traffic across servers
	- Load balancers have multiple algorithms for this
		- Least Connection Method:
		- Round Robin
		- IP Hash
		- Write other
- On the web, there is Content Delivery Networks (CDN). They provide cache close to the system requesting the data. Ideal for serving static media.
- Caching has issues too, like maintaining data consistency, and making sure the cached data is the same as the source data. This is solved through cache invalidation strategies
	- Write Through: Ensures consistency at cost of write latency
	- Write Around: Data bypasses cache directly to host. Ensures data consistency but increases latency for new data.
	- Write Back: Data is written to cache first, later written to storage. Low latency but risks data lost
	- Cache can reach capacity of data, there needs to a be an "eviction policy" to make room for new data
		- Least recently used
		- FIFO
		- Least frequently used
- How should data be stored?:
	- SQL: Relational database. Store data in tables with predefined schemas (?)
	- NoSQL: Non-relational databases, come in 4 main types
		- Key-value stores (Redis)
		- Document Database (MongoDB, firebase)
		- Wide-Column stores (cassandra)
		- Graph database (neo4j)
- SQL has a rigid schema while nosql has a flexible schema (?)
- SQL follows ACID principles, nosql usually doesnt
- SQL useful in business applications with assured reliability. Like financial applications.
- Database indexes:
	- Primary Key: Unique identifier for each record
	- Secondary Index: Additional indexes on non-primary key columns
	- Composite Index
- Foreign key in a record is a constraint that enforces a relationship between columns and different tables.
- Partitioning is the process of breaking data up into smaller more manageable parts
	- Horizontal Partitioning (sharding)
	- Vetical Partitioning
	- Directory-based Partitioning
	- Different methods of hashing
		- Consistent Hashing
		- List partitioning
		- Round Robin
		- Composite Partitioning
- As the number of concurrent sockets grow, performance degrades due to contention and resource exhaustion. This limitation is addressed using
	- Non-blocking IO/ Async IO
	- Event driven architectures
- TCP sockets contain a finite state machine
- UDX sockets use a file path instead of a network location, which makes them faster, being able to bypass the network stack
- Sockets are inherently insecure. Socket security is usually achieved with TLS (transport layer security)
# Questions
- What is a file descriptor?
