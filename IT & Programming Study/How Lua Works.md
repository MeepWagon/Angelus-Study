- Files necessary to compile lua: luaxlib, lstate, ldebug, ldo, lfunc, lgc, lmem, lobject, lstring, ltable, ltm, lundump, lvm.c, lmathlib.c, lopcodes, lzio, lparser, ldump
- Files unecessary  to compile lua: lapi, lbaselib, lcode, lcorolib (probably for coroutines), lctype, ldblib, 
- Lua uses a "while-switch dispatch loop". (Learn more about what that is)
- Lua types are "attached to values rather than variables". What does that mean? I suspect the "rather than variables" part means instead of writing the data type next to the variable name, it attaches the type to the value. But that's the part I don't understand.

- What is a union? How is it different from a struct?
- "Strings, tables, functions, threads, and userdata values are implemented by reference: v contains pointers to structures that implement those values. Those structures share a common head, which keeps information needed for garbage collection." What does this mean exactly? How is this implemented in the source code?
- Several dynamically typed languages use spare bits in each pointer to store the values type (as opposed to Lua using a whole byte). But the technique is not portable, and doesnt work with ANSI C (Why?). The C standard does not even ensures that a pointer fits in any ==integral== type and so there is no standard way to perform bit manipulation over pointers. (what does this mean? What is an integral?)
- For less overhead when creating variables, it would be better to use an explicit tag instead of an integer tag. Why?
