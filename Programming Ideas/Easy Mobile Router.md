# Idea
A program that creates a router using a laptop and a phone with data service. I basically want to create an app that constantly runs on a phone searching for a signal saying to activate. Once activated, it will start a hot spot and proxy server that directs all traffic through to the phones cellular network.

I'm thinking, for the mobile app, it would just be an app with a singular button, turns it on and off. When on, it would search for the signal sent from the computer to start the proxy server. For the computer app, I want the GUI to consist of some network status information and a button to turn it on and off. Turning it on would send a signal to the mobile app and start a hot spot for connection, directing all traffic to the proxy.

# Questions:
- How is a hot spot created in software? How does the OS allow the facilitate the creation of an access point? Can it be created with code directly without using shell commands?
- Can the data be routed with certain rules made with code?
