# Idea
- Create a virtual environment where devices (routers, switches, ect) can be dragged and dropped to create network simulations. Traffic between nodes can be monitored, and there will be a special virtual network node that the users device can actually connect to.
# Details
- Signal loss over distance
- Subnets
- 
# Devices
- Switch
- Router
- Hub
- Bridge
- Cables (of different types & connectors)
# Implementation Details
