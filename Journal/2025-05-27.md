Second journal entry. I got off work early today. I was told I'd be allowed to, so hopefully I don't get in trouble because of it. It was pretty slow today at work so I imagine that's the reason why. I actually got some praise from my in training supervisor, which was cool. I'm hoping to leverage that into something greater. So lets hope I didn't fuck that up by leaving early.

I'm still working on my neovim config. Mostly working on my package manager. It's coming along and I want to try and finish it today. I have honestly thought of a lot of other development projects I'd like to create. Definitely will have a nice portfolio to show off if I ever get around to actually working on them.

I tried doing more push ups today. I got around ten? I didn't count exactly, but I did worse than yesterday. I got closer to thirty, spread out obviously. I don't think my muscles have completely healed from yesterday. I'm also concerned about my diet, there is a lot of misinformation on the topic so I'm unsure how I should be eating to bulk up exactly.

I've been wanting to do this thing where I take an hour long session to just think everyday. I haven't gotten around to it yet, not exactly sure when the best time to do it is. I'm kind of busy most days. I should probably leave it for my days off. But, the idea is to just play some white noise, close my eyes and just think. Alternatively, I could do it in the shower, but I would also prune the hell up.

Anyway, that's all for now.
